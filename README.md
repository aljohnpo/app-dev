*angelito ang batang ama*
The fictional provincial town of San Vicente is home to the dysfunctional Santos family, consisting of 18-year old graduating high school student Angelito (JM de Guzman), his younger sister Teresa, nicknamed "Tere", and their grandmother Pinang (Elizabeth Oropesa), who has custody of the two following their mother's death and father's desertation. Pinang runs a small fishmonger and green grocery business in the town's wet market, and is often helped by Angelito alongside studying in order to make ends meet. In school, Angelito has a close circle of friends or a clique, which includes Rex, Sponky (Felix Roco), and Boyet (Carl John Barrameda).
